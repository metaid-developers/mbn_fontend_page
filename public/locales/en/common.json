      "0": {
        "title": "Is MetaBitcoin Network a specific chain? Does it have a project token?",
        "content": "MBN is NOT a specific chain or project; it is a practical solution for extending the Bitcoin network. It utilizes existing UTXO public chains and technologies, combined with suitable asset bridges and data rollup solutions, to create a Bitcoin-based Web3 solution. This approach not only aims to extend Bitcoin as digital gold but also serves as a Web3 network capable of accommodating the everyday needs of 8 billion users.\n\nIt does not have a specific project token and has not received VC funding; it is a permissionless, fully open solution designed for the future emergence of massive Web3 applications. It represents a vision and, from a technical perspective, may be the simplest and most elegant approach to building a Web3 scalability solution for Bitcoin."
      },
      "1": {
        "title": "Why does MetaBitcoin Network connect UTXO public chains like MVC and BCH?",
        "content": "MBN can be compatible with most of the mainstream UTXO public chains nowadays, including BCH, BSV, FB and MVC, etc. MBN has no preference for any UTXO public chains that meet the standards. MBN will link the mainstream UTXO public chains and their replica chains. Ultimately, which solution is used the most will be decided by the users, so different UTXO public chains connected to MBN will compete in terms of performance, fees, and smart contract capabilities to attract the most users.\n\nConnecting different types of UTXO public chains provides more possibilities for enriching Bitcoin assets. For example, after MBN connects to BCH, Bitcoin assets may be able to utilize the EVM layer on BCH to achieve more possibilities; after MBN connects to MVC, Bitcoin assets may be able to utilize the layer-one smart contract capabilities on MVC to achieve more complex financial and Web3 use cases."

      "2": {
        "title": "What's the relationship between MetaBitcoin Network and MetaID?",
        "content": "MetaBitcoin is a Bitcoin expansion plan proposed by the MetaID protocol team. The MetaID protocol is a Web3 construction plan designed for Bitcoin. Based on the MetaID protocol, various Web3 applications can be developed in the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as on-chain Twitter, on-chain Facebook, on-chain Amazon, and on-chain TikTok. However, Bitcoin has not solved the scalability issue, resulting in extremely high fees and congestion, preventing these on-chain applications from being widely promoted. Therefore, the MetaID protocol team proposed a scalability solution for Bitcoin. The MetaID protocol team believes that the MetaID protocol + MBN solution can establish a permissionless, open Web3 world on Bitcoin that can accommodate massive daily use by users."
      },
      "3": {
        "title": "What's the relationship between MetaBitcoin Network and FB?",
        "content": "Some of the goals and visions of MBN and FB are the same. They both aim to expand Bitcoin and do so by connecting other chains with BTC as the core. However, there are three main differences:\n1. FB can only link the BCSP (Bitcoin Core Software Package) constructed by the replication program of Bitcoin Core nodes, while MBN is more open and can be compatible with all existing UTXO public chains that meet the conditions, including BCH, BSV, MVC, and even FB; MBN can include FB, but FB cannot include MBN; FB has a dedicated project token and a dedicated project team, while MBN has no tokens or funding. It is a combination solution that utilizes existing public chains and technologies, requiring no significant development itself, and is more of an open, permissionless technical combination solution belonging to the developer community.\n2. Because MBN is more open and can be compatible with all excellent UTXO public chains in the industry (such as BCH, MVC, etc.), MBN has more advanced capabilities than FB, such as utilizing the EVM layer on BCH and the layer-one UTXO smart contract capabilities on MVC. This gives Bitcoin assets more possibilities and makes full use of all mature ecosystems in the larger Bitcoin ecosystem.\n3. FB is more positioned to expand Bitcoin as digital gold and electronic currency (according to its official website and white paper), and FB's architecture and design are not suitable for large amounts of data on-chain and lack a Web3 construction plan. MBN, from day one, was planned and designed to solve the future massive Web3 applications on Bitcoin. Its goal is clear and straightforward: to use the MetaID protocol and existing large Bitcoin ecosystem facilities to build a secure, user-owned data, high-performance Web3 network on Bitcoin that can meet the daily needs of people worldwide."
